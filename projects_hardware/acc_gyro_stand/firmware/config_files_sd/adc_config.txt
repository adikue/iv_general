*
* 
* SPI_RESET_TIMER
* This bit sets the number of fCLK cycles in which SCLK is inactive the SPI interface will reset. This
* places a lower limit on the frequency of SCLK in which to read or write data to the device. The SPI
* interface only is reset and not the device itself. When the SPI interface is reset, it is ready for a new
* command.
* Values:
* 4096 = Reset when SCLK inactive for 4096fCLK cycles (256µs, fCLK = 16MHz) (default).
* 256 = Reset when SCLK inactive for 256fCLK cycles (16µs, fCLK = 16MHz).
*
SPI_RESET_TIMER 256
*
* SCAN_MODE
* This bit sets either the Auto-Scan or Fixed-Channel mode of operation.
* In Auto-Scan mode, the input channel selections are eight differential channels (DIFF0–DIFF7) and 16
* single-ended channels (AIN0–AIN15). Additionally, five internal monitor readings can be selected.
* These selections are made in SCAN_DIFF_CHANNELS, SCAN_SE_CHANNELS, and SCAN_SYSTEM. In this mode,
* settings FIXED_CHANNEL_N_IN and FIXED_CHANNEL_P_IN have no effect. See the Auto-Scan Mode section in ADS1258 
* datasheet for more details.
*
* In Fixed-Channel mode, any of the analog input channels may be selected for the positive
* measurement and the negative measurement channels. The inputs are selected in FIXED_CHANNEL_N_IN and 
* FIXED_CHANNEL_P_IN. In this mode, settings SCAN_DIFF_CHANNELS, SCAN_SE_CHANNELS, and SCAN_SYSTEM have no 
* effect. Note that it is not possible to select the internal monitor readings in this mode.
* Values:
* SCAN = Auto-Scan Mode (default)
* FIXED = Fixed-Channel Mode
*
SCAN_MODE SCAN
*
* MULTIPLEXER
* This bit selects either the internal or external connection from the multiplexer output to the ADC input.
* Note that the Temperature, VCC, Gain, and Reference internal monitor readings automatically use the
* internal connection, regardless of this setting. The Offset reading uses this setting.
* Values:
* INT = ADC inputs use internal multiplexer connection (default).
* EXT = ADC inputs use external ADC inputs (ADCINP and ADCINN).
*
MULTIPLEXER INT
*
* CLK_OUT
* This bit enables the clock output on pin CLKIO. The clock output originates from the device crystal
* oscillator and PLL circuit.
* Note: If the CLKSEL pin is set to '1', the CLKIO pin is a clock input only. In this case, setting this bit
* has no effect.
* Values:
* DISABLE = Clock output on CLKIO disabled.
* ENABLE = Clock output on CLKIO enabled (default).
*
CLK_OUT ENABLE
*
* CHOPPING
* This setting enables the chopping feature on the external multiplexer loop.
* The chopping feature corrects for offset originating from components used in the external multiplexer
* loop; see the External Chopping section in ADS1258 datasheet.
* Note that for Internal System readings (Temperature, VCC, Gain, and Reference), the CHOP bit must
* be 0.
* Values:
* DISABLE = Chopping Disabled (default)
* ENABLE = Chopping Enabled
*
CHOPPING DISABLE
*
* STATUS_BYTE
* When reading channel data from the ADS1258, a status byte is normally included with the conversion
* data. However, in some ADS1258 operating modes, the status byte can be disabled. Table 17, Status
* Byte, shows the modes of operation and the data read formats in which the status byte can be
* disabled.
* Values:
* DISABLE = Status Byte Disabled
* ENABLE = Status Byte Enabled (default)
* Note:
* |MODE 			|CHANNEL DATA READ COMMAND 			|CHANNEL DATA READ DIRECT
* |Auto-Scan 		|Always Enabled 					|Enabled/Disabled by STAT Bit
* |Fixed-Channel 	|Always Enabled (Byte is Undefined) |Always Disabled
*
STATUS_BYTE ENABLE
*
* IDLE_MODE
* This bit selects the Idle mode when the device is not converting, Standby or Sleep. The Sleep mode
* offers lower power consumption but has a longer wake-up time to re-enter the run mode; see the Idle
* Modes section.
* Values:
* STANBY = Select Standby Mode
* SLEEP = Select Sleep Mode (default)
*
IDLE_MODE SLEEP
*
* SWITCH_DELAY
* This set the amount of time the converter will delay after indexing to a new channel but before
* starting a new conversion. This value should be set large enough to allow for the full settling of
* external filtering or buffering circuits used between the MUXOUTP, MUXOUTN, and ADCINP,
* ADCINN pins; see the Switch Time Delay section in ADS1258 datasheet. (default = 000)
*
SWITCH_DELAY 000
*
* SENSOR_BIAS
* This set the sensor bias current source.
* Values:
* OFF = Sensor Bias Current Source Off (default)
* 15 = 1.5µA Source
* 24 = 24µA Source
*
SENSOR_BIAS OFF
*
* DATA_RATE
* This set the data rate of the converter. Slower reading rates yield increased resolution; see
* table below. The actual data rates shown in the table can be slower, depending on the use of Switch Time
* Delay or the Chop feature. See the Switch Time Delay section in ADS1258 datasheet. The reading rate scales 
* with the master clock frequency.
* Note:		 
* |DATA_RATE Value 	|AUTO-SCAN MODE(SPS)	|FIXED-CHANNEL MODE(SPS)
* |11 (default)		|23739 					|125000
* |10 				|15123 					|31250
* |01 				|6168  					|7813
* |00 				|1831  					|1953
*
DATA_RATE 11
*
* FIXED_CHANNEL_P_IN FIXED_CHANNEL_N_IN
* This selects the input channels of the multiplexer to be used for the Fixed-Channel mode. In this mode, bits 
* FIXED_CHANNEL_N_IN select the analog input channel for the negative ADC input, and bits FIXED_CHANNEL_P_IN 
* select the analog input channel for the positive ADC input. See the Fixed-Channel Mode section in ADS1258 datasheet.
*
FIXED_CHANNEL_P_IN 0
FIXED_CHANNEL_N_IN 15
*
* SCAN_DIFF_CHANNELS SCAN_SE_CHANNELS SCAN_SYSTEM
* These three settings select the input channels and the internal readings for measurement in Auto-Scan mode.
* For differential channel selections (DIFF0…DIFF7), adjacent input pins (AIN0/AIN1, AIN2/AIN3, etc.) are pre-set
* as differential inputs. All single-ended inputs are measured with respect to the AINCOM input. AINCOM may be
* set to any level within ±100mV of the analog supply range. Channels not selected are skipped in the
* measurement sequence.
* Values (Bit mask fopr channels. For 0 and 1 channel correct value will be 0x3. Values strictly are in HEX):
* SCAN_DIFF_CHANNELS: 	0x00..0xFF (default 0x00)
* |7 	 |6 	|5 	   |4 	  |3 	 |2 	|1 	   |0
